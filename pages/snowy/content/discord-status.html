<h2>My Discord Status Meanings</h2>
<p>As I am a admin for a Discord server, I thought I'd create this.</p>
<p>Yeah, the server is QUITE dead, but I care for it with my heart <3</p>

<h2>General Status Types</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Online – Available, might be busy or not... I might respond quickly or take a couple of minutes with this status. It depends.</li>
    <li>Idle / Away – Away from my device. Most likely available or busy.</li>
    <li>Do Not Disturb / DND – Busy, available, or just don’t want to be disturbed. It’s fine to ping or DM me about something. I may take some time to respond in this status.</li>
    <li>Offline / Invisible – Hiding from the world. Likely busy or available. It’s fine to ping or DM me about something.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Custom Status Meanings (Emojis)</h2>
<ul>
    <li>🌙 – Tired. Best not to disturb. It's fine to check up on me and/or warn me about something in DMs.</li>
    <li>💻 – Working on something. I’m slightly busy but still able to talk if needed.</li>
    <li>⚠️ – Busy or stressed. Better not to disturb. Best to check up on me and give any warnings in DMs.</li>
    <li>💤 – Probably dead (not literally — just sleeping).</li>
    <li>🚫 – Not social. I'd prefer silence. You can still ping or DM me, but I may be angy.</li>
    <li>💬 – Free to talk!</li>
    <li>🔇 – Muted in VC... OR I’m lurking. Who knows 🤷‍♂️</li>
    <li>💢 – Annoyed or frustrated. Fine to contact, but do so with caution.</li>
</ul>
